I am currently a final year PhD student at the University of Washington advised by Prof. Dieter Fox. I am actively seeking new career opportunities and am in the job market.

Before that, I received my M.S. degree in Control Science and Technology from Tsinghua University advised by Prof. Xiangyang Ji and my bachelor's degree in Automation from Tsinghua University. I also worked with Dr. Jifeng Dai as a research intern at Microsoft Research Asia.

My research focuses on perception and reasoning in robotics.
