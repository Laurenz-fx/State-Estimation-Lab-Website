I am a PhD student at the University of Washington supervised by Prof. Dieter Fox (RSE lab) and Prof. Abhishek Gupta (WEIRD lab).

In 2024, I interned at Bosch USA, Pittsburgh working with Jonathan Francis and Bingqing Chen.

In 2022, I graduated with a Master's in Computer Science from TU Darmstadt, focusing on computer vision and robot learning, and minoring in Entrepreneurship & Innovation.

I was on an exchange at EPFL, where I wrote my thesis at VILAB supervised by Prof. Amir Zamir (and formally Prof. Stefan Roth). I was a student research assistant at the AI&ML Lab of Prof. Kristian Kersting (2020-2021) and MEC-Lab of Dr. Anirban Mukhopadhyay (2020-2021) and collaborated with the IAS group of Prof. Jan Peters (2020-2021). Furthermore, I worked as a part-time Machine Learning Engineer at Sopra Steria SA (2020).

In 2019, I received my Bachelor of Science in Business Information Systems from the Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg Cooperative State University Mannheim (DHBW) and got awarded the Best Graduate Award for my academic achievements. As part of the program, I worked part-time as a Software Engineer at Knauf IT (2016-2019) and took part in an exchange with Appalachian State University (2018).
