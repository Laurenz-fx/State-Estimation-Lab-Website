I obtained my bachelor degree from National University of Singapore (NUS). Currently I am a PhD candidate at University of Washington under Prof. Dieter Fox.

My research interests are in robot perception, planning and control. I am especially interested in developing algorithms and representations to seamlessly connect perception, planning and control to improve the capability and robustness of robots in the open world.

I have worked on several aspects of this theme in the context of robot navigation, agile locomotion, and manipulation. On the perception front, I have worked on scene representation for off-road driving and domain adaptation to improve generalization. For planning, I developed compact topological world models that do not require accurate geometric mapping. For control, I connect learning and physics, e.g. using imitation learning to learn controllers from vision, and using reinforcement learning to learn agile quadrupedal locomotion skills.

My focus has always been robust execution in the open world with minimum assumptions. Hence, having large-scale datasets for training has been crucial. Due to the steep cost of collecting world data, I invest in scaling up low-cost, high-quality data generation using photorealistic simulators, such as Gibson and Isaac Sim. I believe it will eventually allow us to train robots in simulation and deploy them in the real world. It also enables large-scale reproducible evaluation to find corner cases, a key aspect to improve the robustness of the robot, and make them safe and predictable in the real world.
