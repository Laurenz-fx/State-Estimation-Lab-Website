I am a Ph.D. student in the Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Washington, advised by Professor Siddhartha Srinivasa (Personal Robotics Lab) and Professor Dieter Fox (Robotics and State Estimation Lab). My research interests are in the areas of perception, representation, and planning for robot manipulation.

Before my Ph.D., I completed my Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science with a specialization in Robotics and a minor in AI at the University of Toronto. There, I conducted research on Learning-based Perception for Transparent Objects, advised by Prof. Animesh Garg (People AI and Robotics Lab) and Prof. Florian Shkurti (Robot Vision and Learning Lab). Apart from my academic pursuits, I have worked as a research intern at Huawei Technologies R&D Canada, computer vision intern at EATLAB, and undergraduate research assistant at the National University of Singapore.

I have been honored to receive the CRA Outstanding Undergraduate Research Award - Honourable Mention and the National Undergraduate Research Award (NSERC USRA) in 2022 and 2021, respectively.

I have had the priviledge to work with some amazing collaborators, and am always looking for motivated students and new collaborations. Drop me an email if you are interested!
