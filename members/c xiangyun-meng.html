<p>I obtained my bachelor degree from National University of Singapore (NUS). Currently I am a PhD candidate at University of Washington under Prof. Dieter Fox.</p>

<p>My research interests are in robot perception, planning and control. I am especially interested in developing algorithms and representations to seamlessly connect perception, planning and control to improve the capability and robustness of robots in the open world.</p>

<p>I have worked on several aspects of this theme in the context of robot navigation, agile locomotion, and manipulation. On the perception front, I have worked on scene representation for off-road driving and domain adaptation to improve generalization. For planning, I developed compact topological world models that do not require accurate geometric mapping. For control, I connect learning and physics, e.g. using imitation learning to learn controllers from vision, and using reinforcement learning to learn agile quadrupedal locomotion skills.</p>

<p>My focus has always been robust execution in the open world with minimum assumptions. Hence, having large-scale datasets for training has been crucial. Due to the steep cost of collecting world data, I invest in scaling up low-cost, high-quality data generation using photorealistic simulators, such as Gibson and Isaac Sim. I believe it will eventually allow us to train robots in simulation and deploy them in the real world. It also enables large-scale reproducible evaluation to find corner cases, a key aspect to improve the robustness of the robot, and make them safe and predictable in the real world.</p>
