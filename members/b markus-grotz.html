<p>Markus is a passionate Postdoctoral Researcher in Dieter’s lab at the University of Washington. His academic journey began at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT), where he collaborated with Tamim and his team, exploring the field of advanced humanoid robots.</p>

<p>His research focuses on visual perception for grasping and manipulation tasks, combining theoretical concepts with practical applications in robotics and AI. He is particularly fascinated by the interdisciplinary nature of robotics, which integrates elements from computer science, engineering, and systems integration to solve complex problems.</p>

<p>Currently, he is actively involved in the “Robotic Manipulation in Densely Packed Containers” project. This research focuses on automation for industrial warehouses, where densely packed objects are challenging to distinguish visually, requiring manipulation techniques sensitive to object arrangements. His role includes coordinating research efforts, managing schedules and goals, and overseeing software architecture.</p>
